# Repository Name
Short and memorable name of this new project. 

Examples: 

> flink-remote-shuffle

# Description
A short descriptive summary of the project. A short paragraph, ideally one sentence in length. 

Examples (ai-flow):
> AI Flow is an open source framework that bridges big data and artificial intelligence.

# Proposal
A lengthier description of the proposal. Should be reasonably declarative. More discursive material should be included in the rationale.

Example (ai-flow):
> AIFlow is an open source framework that bridges big data and artificial intelligence. It manages the entire machine learning lifecycle as a unified workflow, including feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, model service, model inference, monitoring, etc.
> 
> In addition to the capability of orchestrating a group of batch jobs, by leveraging an event-based scheduler(enhanced version of Apache Airflow), AIFlow also supports workflows that contain streaming jobs. Such capability is quite useful for complicated real-time machine learning systems as well as other real-time workflows.

# Documentation

# Initial Source
Describes the origin of the proposed code base. If the initial code arrives from more than one source, this is the right place to outline the different histories.

If there is no initial source, please describe the current status of the proposed code base.
